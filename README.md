# Etools V2

Internal POC website that provides tools to assist colleagues with post-production workflows. It attempts to integrate Svelte for the frontend with Flask on the backend.

Meant to replace "etools", the first attempt at internal webs app. This frontback/backend currently runs on seperate server from the previous etools, but requests are forwarded between them seemlessly.

Requires "rosettapath" and "filescanner" libraries, which should already be included in pyproject.toml via github.
