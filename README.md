# SvelteFlask

Internal POC website that provides tools that attempts to integrate Svelte with assist colleagues with post-production workflows. Meant to replace "etools". This frontback/backend currently runs on seperate server from the previous etools, but requests are forwarded between them seemlessly.

Requires "rosettapath" and "filescanner" libraries, which should already be included in pyproject.toml through github.
