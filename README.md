# Etools V2

Internal POC website that provides tools to assist colleagues with post-production workflows. It attempts to integrate Svelte for the frontend with Flask on the backend.

Meant to replace "etools", the first attempt at internal web app. This app currently only partially replaces the previous etools, so requests to the remaining endpoints are forwarded to the old app seemlessly.

"rosettapath" and "filescanner" dependencies are included in pyproject.toml via github.
