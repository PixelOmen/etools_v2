# Etools V2

Internal web app enabling access to tools that assist with post-production workflows at Roundabout Entertainment.

Integrating Svelte and Flask, it is meant to replace "etools", the first attempt at an internal web app. This app currently only partially replaces the previous etools, so requests to the remaining endpoints are forwarded to the old app seemlessly.

`rosettapath` and `filescanner` dependencies are included in pyproject.toml via github.
